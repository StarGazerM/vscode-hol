# vscode-hol

this is my personal vscode setting for HOL-theorem prover.

actually I just copy and paste something from existed vscode document, and some other extensions....

## NOW I HAVE

- `alt+h h`: create a hol terminal in vscode
- `alt+h k`: kill hol process
- `alt+h alt+r`: run selected code in hol
- `alt+h g`: set selected code as goal
- `alt+h p`: print current goal
- `alt+h e`: apply selected code as a HOL tactic
